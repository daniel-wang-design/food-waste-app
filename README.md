## Inspiration
We noticed that a lot of restaurants throw away perfectly good food at the end of each day as they are unable to sell it. We also noticed that businesses usually had sales near the end of the day to try to sell out all of their food. We decided that there has to be a better way to use all the leftover food, so with that in mind, we created Cheap Eats. It was surprising that none or a very little nuumber of businesses donated their end-of-the-day food even though there are no legal constraints as the Donation of Food act(Ontario) prevents businesses and individuals from legal consequences for food donated in good cause. 

## What it does
Our app helps connect customers to businesses during the closing hours of the day to try to reduce or eliminate food waste as customers are able to purchase discounted food and businesses are able to make some money off of it. We have an intuitive user interface which allows users to see available restaurants in their area, the cost, and the number of food items left in the restaurant. This provides convenience to customers which greatly increases the chances of them buying food from businesses at the end of the day which would otherwise be thrown out. Our app also has a charity tab for businesses,  where they are able to set up a pick up time to donate their food to a local charity, instead of throwing the food into the trash. 

## How we built it
The project was coded using the programming language Dart, and the framework Flutter by Google. Different pages were used for each of the different aspects of the app, and elements were custom made to fit the feel and aesthetic of our app. 

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into included depreciated code as a lot of the online tutorials were outdated, resulting in the content presented being useless. Instead, we had to rely on the APIs as well as official documentation along with our intuition to code our app.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of the accomplishments that we are proud of include being able to create a functional app that can be exported onto an Android device as a .apk file within 2 days' time. We had limited knowledge in the framework and the coding language, so grasping the concepts in such a short amount of time is an acheievemnet in itself. 

## What we learned
We learned the basics of app building such as user input, screen resolutions, how page animations work, etc. 

## What's next for Cheap Eats
A next step would be to have Cheap Eats  accept payments through the app to further smooth the transaction process of buying discounted food, both for the businesses, and for the customers. This in turn would help shed some positive light on the massive problem of food waste.
